# DEFCON 26 INFOBOOTH Key
## The Key to Misinformation

This is the Infobooth Key Badge for DEFCON 26. Created at the behest of Mello and Littlebruzer. 

## Bill of Materials

* [6mm square Buttons](https://www.adafruit.com/product/367) - I couldn't find this on mouser, and I needed 60 of them.
* [Coin Cell Battery Holder](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Eagle-Plastic-Devices/122-2520-GR?qs=sGAEpiMZZMtT9MhkajLHrsmOeam3f13HF0ge4CP9ILI%3d) - This stands off the board. This is good for me, but finding one without the standoffs would be good.
* [ATTINY84](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/556-ATTINY84A-PU)
* [10K Pulldown Resistor](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/603-MFR-25FRF5210K)
* [3mm Amber LEDs](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Vishay-Semiconductors/TLHE4600?qs=%2fjqivxn91ccKeAJQzr9uyA==)
* [5mm Red LEDs](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Kingbright/WP63SRD?qs=7QlcvZZejStVbcM3wnr71w==)
* [57.6ohm Resistor](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/KOA-Speer/MF1-4DC57R6F?qs=sGAEpiMZZMsPqMdJzcrNwlJRvxcOW1fvRk6trFl%252b2HE=) - for the eye LEDs. Only 1 per badge.
* [110ohm Resistor](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/603-MFR-25FBF52-110R) - 8 per badge. For amber LEDs
* CR2032 battery. Avalible...anywhere?

## Code

The code is fairly simple. it just creates a  bunch of cool animations. It was originally supposed to do game state, but the game didn't get finished before I had to make the badge happen, so I just dumped in the animations. There's a goal for DEFCON 27 to have the code re-finished and therefore be able to re-program everyone's badge with a game.

## Special Thanks

Mouse - for help with the pulldown resistor, as well as general cheerleadership :)

Mello - for running the Infobooth that i've been calling home the last 5 years.

Littlebruzer - for encouraging me to do this. I wouldn't probably have ever made this without your pushing me to work on it.
